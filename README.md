Apple appears to have stopped updating their Reachability code. It isn't marked up with nullability for use with Swift projects, it doesn't use ARC, and is generally inflexible. Nexum is a drop-in replacement for Apple's reachability that is still extremely similar and very simple, but designed for easy, drop-in use and more design flexibility. Not everyone wants to use NSNotification all the time :P
